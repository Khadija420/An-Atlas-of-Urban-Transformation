                HOW TO USE IT?
            </h1>

            <p class="description">
                The map intends to become a visual tool containing in itself all the data about development projects,
                aiding the knowledge of the inhabitants in the area and helping them add to it through incident
                reporting. Most of these initiatives are already organizing online through Facebook, but very much in
                silos, so this will synergize and scale up the connections.

                Architects and urban planners, both in government and academia, have systematically ignored the informal
                and self-organized dynamics of the city to inform land use plans and public policies. planned almost 60
                years ago, today it is experienced in a different way, and the new dynamics, uses and activities must
                also be recognized and included in urban planning. Use the strategies below to understand the new uses
                and activities that many spaces have not previously prescribed, but which demonstrate the interest and
                need of many residents. Use them to also understand what challenges groups face and how laws, policies
                and urban instruments could facilitate these processes.</p>
