     <strong> At the moment, OCCO (Office of Conservation and Community Outreach) Lahore is interested in expanding the research base on Lahore. With further conversation and funding available, they could potentially incorporate the additive, interactive and participatory mapping portal into their existing App “Archi-tour Lahore”. Interviews and conversations with the Lahore Conservation Society has yielded substantial information about the bureaucratic control of land and corruption at higher government factions. Yet any actionable strategies haven’t been identified so far. Goethe Institute, Germany has published “Urbanities - art and public space in Pakistan,” after a year-long research in collaboration with Lahore Biennale Foundation. They can be a potential partner and source of funding after the resource mobilization manual has been designed for its dissemination and potential collaborations for public workshops/exhibitions on the “transformation of Lahore”. As the long term goal, I have some ideas about establishing an “Urban Resource center” specifically for Lahore, as the long-term goal after this year long thesis, for which the Urban Unit, Lahore, a semi-autonomous body working as a consultant on various urban development projects can be collaborated with. </strong>
